#  Day 43 100DaysOfSwiftUI Challenge
DONE: Change project 7 (iExpense) so that it uses NavigationLink for adding new expenses rather than a sheet. 
    (Tip: The dismiss() code works great here, but you might want to add the navigationBarBackButtonHidden() modifier so they have to explicitly choose Cancel.)

DONE: Try changing project 7 so that it lets users edit their issue name in the navigation title rather than a separate textfield. Which option do you prefer?

Return to project 8 (Moonshot), and upgrade it to use NavigationLink(value:). This means adding Hashable conformance, and thinking carefully how to use navigationDestination().
